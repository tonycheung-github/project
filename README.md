There are two main purposes for this repository. They are as follows:
- to practice and demonstrate how to organize and name the files and folders in an organized and standardized way such that someone new to a project will still be able to easily navigate through the file structure and find and use what needs to be found and used, while being able to be searchable with computer searches as well due to standardized naming
- to explore and practice some of the capabilities of Conda, by setting up an environment and utilizing conda to install the specific components needed for the environment
